                                              Over my head 
                                I see a bronze             <span style="color:rgb(77, 77, 206)">butterfly</span>
                            Asleep on                         the black trunk
                      Blowing like a                              leaf in green shadow
                   Down the ravine                                 behind the empty house,
                The cowbells                                             follow one another 
               Into the distances                                          of the afternoon
                To my right,                                          In a field of sunlight
                  betweem two pines                            The droppings of last year's 
                    horses Blaze up                                   into golden stones.
                      I lean back, as                     evening darkens and comes on.
                          A chicken hawk floats           over, looking for home.
                          <br>
                                         I have wasted my <span style="color:rgb(77, 77, 206)">life.</span>
