        <div>Throughout the second week of class, we expanded more on the different
            functions of HTML. Before this class, I had never used a program like
            visual studio code or thought I would even learn how to code. It seemed
            like something that was too complex for me to pick up. However, after
            these first two weeks, I feel that I have a good general understanding of
            some of the basic functions of HTML. We learned how to perform actions
            such as adding paragraphs, links, images, and lists to a webpage. Through
            the extensions we downloaded in class I was able to see the webpage I was
            making live and see the changes in real time. I inserted images of two
            kitties in my first webpage and then linked those images to a second
            webpage I created. It felt satisfying to see the code I had typed out
            transfer over to a real working webpage, even though the page was very
            basic.
            We discussed the upcoming exercise 1 in class which involves creating an
            interactive hypertext narrative website. I'm very excited for this
            upcoming assignment, both because I have many ideas for it, and because I
            want to experiment with the different functions of html I've learned. I
            want to be able to link many different images to new webpages, creating a
            story that you are able to click through. I've been working on
            developing my personal art style more in these past couple of weeks, so I
            hope to include some of my own drawings in the exercise. Some aspects of
            HTML are still a bit confusing to me, as all the coding software is a very
            new experience, but I hope that it will soon come natural to me.

            <div>The third week of class was very short in comparison to the previous
    weeks, as we only had one class on Wednesday. That day we learned about
    CSS and how to add design elements to a website. Again, because this is
    another aspect of coding a website that is so new to me, it all seemed
    kind of confusing. There are so many different things that you can do to a
    website to change the layout to make it specific to what you want, and
    there are so many short cuts and phrases to remember to help you out when
    designing. With more practice though, I am hopeful that soon I can design
    a website with ease. So far, although it can get confusing, I am having
    fun learning how to use visual studio code. I really enjoy seeing
    everything I type out come together on a webpage.
    During week three I had to work on both a PowerPoint presentation about
    the World Wide Web, and work on my hypertext project. The PowerPoint
    wasn't too difficult to work on, as my group's topic was pretty broad,
    covering the history and beginning of the internet. The readings we had to
    do to get the information on the topic were pretty interesting, and I
    learned some new things about the beginnings of the internet I didn't
    know before. Working on my hypertext project, however, was a bit more
    difficult than working on the PowerPoint. It took me a bit to get the
    project started because I didn't fully remember how to begin a new
    project on visual studio code. Once I did get it started, though, I got
    into a nice flow putting down what I needed to code for my project. It
    took me a while to fully complete mine because I decided to draw my own
    images for my concept, but I am very happy with how the project turned
    out. Some points got complicated, as the number of pages I needed to link
    to kept increasing, but I am very satisfied with the end result.

        <div class="weekly-left" id="C">
            <div>This past week we took a look at how to style our webpages with CSS. As
                with HTML, I had never heard of CSS before this class. The demonstrations
                in class helped me gain a basic understanding of how to use CSS, however
                there are so many things you can do that it feels a bit overwhelming.
                Especially because I have very limited experience in programming in
                general, sometimes the tutorials in class and online are a bit confusing.
                For me, CSS is more frustrating than HTML, so I definitely need more
                practice experimenting with it. This weekend I tried to start working on
                my 5 variations project, but for some reason I couldn't get the CSS
                elements I was inputting to show up on the webpage. I'm not sure what
                I'm doing wrong with it, but I'll figure it out soon.
                Programming so far, although only at a very basic level, has been fun and
                satisfying, so I hope CSS won't continue to frustrate me. I have a lot
                of ideas for the different ways I can make my five variations look, so I
                hope to be able to put what I'm thinking into a webpage successfully.
                In addition to learning about CSS, my group presented our presentation
                about the World Wide Web. The presentation and discussion around the topic
                went well, and I feel like I learned a lot about the internet. I haven't
                presented a PowerPoint in a while, so I was a bit nervous about it, but
                after we got into the flow of the presentation it felt okay.

            <div>At the start of the fifth week, our second exercise, five variations, was
    due. Because I had some trouble getting the CSS on my project to work, I
    spent a lot of time over the previous weekend getting the project ready
    for class. It was fun experimenting with the different aspects of CSS, and
    discovering what I can do with a webpage. I tried to include a diverse
    range of styles to my five webpages, making each of them look unique and
    different. Overall, I was decently proud of how my webpages turned out,
    however there is still a lot I have to learn with CSS. In class, we went
    through everyone's five variations project which I really enjoyed. I got
    to see all the ways people experimented with CSS, which gave me some ideas
    for what I might want to do in the future. I'm looking forward to our
    next website project, andI hope I can create something I will be very
    proud of. In the future, as well, I would like to continue using the
    coding skills I learned in this class to make webpages for personal and
    artistic use.
    This week, we also had our second group discussion on interfaces. This
    discussion was particularly interesting to me because I don't have a lot
    of prior knowledge on interfaces and the history around them. I had read
    the article "What Screens Want", and it was interesting to see and
    think about the way interfaces have developed over the years. I had never
    really thought about how to improve interfaces or why they are the way
    they are, so I enjoyed hearing what people had to say about this topic.

        <div class="weekly-left" id="E">
            <div>This past week, week 7 of the class, we began to think about and create a
                simple structure for our main website portfolio project. Using HTML and
                some simple CSS we were able to create a navigation bar to access
                different pages for our websites. We also learned different ways to style
                images, specifically how to get an image to change its size with the size
                of the page. Next week our project proposals are due, so I have been
                working on my idea throughout the week. My main idea is to create an
                underwater inspired page, where the fish is your cursor as you travel
                through the different pages. I have a few different websites I want to use
                for inspiration, but the elements I want to use from them seem pretty
                complex. I really hope that I will be able to create all the ideas for the
                website I have planned in my proposal. There are still a lot of elements
                of CSS and HTML that I'm not the best at using, but with the next weeks
                of class I think I'll be able to figure out how to create the website I
                want.
                This week on Friday we had another group discussion, this one being about
                online identities. It was interesting to hear about the way these
                identities play a role in politics, and how online identities can create
                both good and bad spaces on the internet. I enjoy how we have the
                discussions one class day out of the week as a way to switch up how we
                spend class time.

    <div class="weekly-right" id="F">
        <div>weekly f</div>
             <div>Week 9 we went over some more important elements that we
        might want to use in our website portfolio project, such as parallax and
        on scroll events. My personal project involves creating an
        underwater/ocean theme portfolio website, and I can see myself utilizing
        parallax for the movement of the underwater creates, and possibly on
        scroll events as well. Some of the specific movements and interactive
        elements I want to use in my website I won't be able to do right away, as
        I need to learn Java script to incorporate them, however I'm still excited
        for the outcome of the first version of the webpage. I really want to be
        able to create an exciting and aesthetically pleasing page for the viewer
        to visit, as well as one that isn't too complicated to navigate.
        In class we were given time to start working on the base structure on our
        websites, however this was kind of hard for me at first. I wasn't sure
        where to start because there are so many elements to even just the first
        landing page of my website, but I was able to break the elements down from
        top to bottom and find a good place to start. I haven't had a lot of time
        so far to work on the website because I've been so busy with other due
        dates, but I hope to get a lot of work done on the website in the next few
        weeks as my workload dies down a bit in my other classes.
             </div>

    <div class="weekly-left" id="G">
        <div>This past week was a shorter week due to the fact that we didn't have
            class on Friday because of Veteran's Day. On that Monday we finished up
            our last of the critiques for project one. For that project we had to
            start making a homepage for our final project websites. For mine I ended
            up creating a rough layout for all of the pages I wanted to include, but I
            still might want to add an about me page to include some fun information
            about myself. After seeing my other classmates work, I have some more
            ideas about what I could put on the page. So many people had such creative
            and fun designs I'm excited to see everyone's finished products. I'm
            really hoping that my finished product will look like the plan I had
            sketched out, or at the very least really close to it. I'm still unsure
            how to add the animations I want to add but we'll probably learn about it
            soon.
            After finishing the critiques, we went into learning about P5.js. Just
            like everything else we've done in this class so far it seems a bit
            complicated and confusing to me but with practice I'm sure I can figure it
            out okay. We have an exercise due this Wednesday to practice drawing
            shapes with P5.js. I haven't had the time yet over the weekend to look
            into it yet, but I hope to work on it throughout Monday and Tuesday. From
            what we've seen so far in class P5.js looks like it can do some pretty
            cool things for a website so I'm excited to start experimenting with it.

        <div>weekly g</div>

    <div class="weekly-right" id="H">
        <div>weekly h</div>
             <div>This past week we took a look again at P5.js and the different things we can do with it. We also got a
                workday in class to work on our projects for exercise 4, drawing with code. I hadn't had time to start the
                exercise until that workday, so I tried to experiment and get a lot done during the class time. I messed
                around with this one rotation feature, which made it look like any shape was moving around in a 3D
                space. It looked very cool, but I didn't end up using it in my final exercise. Making the shape move in that
                way changed the coding of the background which messed up some of the other shapes I had already put
                on my canvas. P5.js is still a bit confusing to me, and while I was at home working on the exercise I kept
                running into problems. Whenever I tried to add in more of the math category functions all my previous
                shapes would disappear, and I'm not sure why. I definitely need to practice experimenting with P5.js a bit
                more to get the hang of it.
                Before our last class on that Friday, I had gone to the Art Career Expo in the union to help make
                connections in the field and look for a potential internship. I had to go before Internet Art because
                otherwise it would collide with the class time, and I needed to go to the critique that day to see what
                other people did for their exercises. Seeing everyone's little projects for the exercise was really helpful
                for me to see what we can do with P5.js, and it gave me some ideas for what I might want to include in
                my final website.
                
             </div>

    <div class="weekly-left" id="I">
        <div>For this last week I spent a lot of time focusing on adding the finishing touches to my portfolio website.
            Before this week I had made the base outline for the website, but it was missing a lot of the moving
            elements that I wanted to include, as well as some of the small fish details. We had learned how to
            create moving elements with p5.js, so I spent time this week getting the fish and shark in the exercises
            page to move. It was kind of difficult to get the one large orange fish to move because rather than just
            moving left to right, the fish needed to move diagonally to the right because of the angle of the GIF.
            Luckily, with some help, I was able to get the fish to move and look alright. I was also able to get the
            cursor to look like a fish, which was an aspect of my original design I really wanted to incorporate. I think
            it adds a fun, interactive element that lets the user make the fish cursor look like it's swimming around
            the website. Overall, I feel like my website turned out looking pretty similar to my original concept. The
            underwater fish theme translated well from my drawings to my website, however I wasn't able to do
            the fish animation I had planned in the beginning, due to time constraints. In the future, I might try to
            add more to the website so I can put every element I wanted to.
